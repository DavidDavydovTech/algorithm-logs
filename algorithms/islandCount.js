// The "Island Count" Problem

// Given a two dimensional array of 1s and 0s, count the number of 
// "islands" of 1s.

// An "island" is a group of adjacent values that are all 1s. Every cell 
// in the array can be adjacent to the two values that are next to it in 
// the same dimension or the two that share it's index in a neighboring dimension.

const islandCount = (arr) => {

}
